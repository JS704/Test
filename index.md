### Introduction

Roche PMDA Summer School is a one-week in-person event for PhD students
interested in learning and applying predictive modelling and data analytics to
problems in drug discovery and development. It will take place between August
7th and 11th in Basel at the Roche campus.

The summer school is organised and sponsored by the **Predictive Modeling and
Data Analytics** (PMDA) chapter, a multidisciplinary team in the department of
Pharmaceutical Sciences, residing in the Pharma Research and Early Development
division of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. The chapter develops and applies data
analysis, visualisation, and modelling tools for pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic studies, biomarkers, and toxicology and safety.

### Topic

The topic of the PMDA summer school 2023 is **computational toxicology** in drug
discovery. The participants will work in teams to analyze and model data and
integrate prior knowledge, with the goal of improving our understanding of
safety profiles of drug candidates. More details shall follow.

### Application

We welcome **Ph.D. students and outstanding master students** of Swiss
universities with backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, data science,
computing sciences, physics, biology and relevant backgrounds to apply before
